    My name is Vita, I am a photographer based in Peterborough England. I came from Lithuania in
    2005, for all this time I have lived in Peterborough. I love to be a photographer because it
    allows me to meet incredible people and gives me an opportunity to listen to their amazing
    stories and present them to others with my photographs.
    <br />
    Now even my kids enjoy helping me out with the busy work of photography. My daughter Samanta and
    her young brother Aironas. Earning themselves some extra allowance in the process.

    Striving to achieve great photographs for my clients, I put pride in my work. With my experience
    ever expanding, my ability to take outstanding photographs and edit them increases day by day. I
    find myself quite busy already with over one hundred photo shoots every year. Nevertheless, I
    look forward for more work to keep me going and provide for my family. Photography is beyond a
    hobby for me, it is my life's passion and purpose. I shall expend the last of my strength to
    provide you the service that you deserve.
