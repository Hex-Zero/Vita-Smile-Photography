    My name is Vita, I am a photographer based in Peterborough England. I came from Lithuania in
    2005, for all this time I have lived in Peterborough. I love to be a photographer because it
    allows me to meet incredible people and gives me an opportunity to listen to their amazing
    stories and present them to others with my photographs.
    <br />
    Now even my kid enjoy helping me out with the busy work of photography. My daughter Samantha and
    her young brother Ironas. Earning themselves some extra allowance in the process.
