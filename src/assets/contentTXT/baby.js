    THE best way to capture lovely photos of their little hands and feet would be within the first 2
    weeks… But, sometimes, for whatever the reason, newborns can’t be photographed within the first
    2 weeks. Then newborns can be photographed at 4 weeks, 6 weeks even 8 weeks. I might have to
    work a little harder to get the baby to sleep, into a pose, but it is worth. Also, I am
    photographing babies with parents and theyr big sisters and brothers… Newborn fotosession could
    be done in my little photo studio or in your house
